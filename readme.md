# 30 Days GitHub Contribution Calendar
```Sql
- first let me tell you why i made this all the old one's out there have 0 styling in them and takes a lot of time experience and effort to understand,
my layout is simple my code is vanilla its perfect for just putting it in your portfolio but still i do have a problem wich is that you can't commit it
on github without creating a .env file with the token and setting a react and node comunication server thingy wich may risk the code base by adding
tons of modules also can risk your account by making the token not only visible but also setting it up to be usable at least in my layout the token is
just there to read it wont do anyone any good hhhh
+ hope who's reading this can help or have an idea to make it a lot better fell free to pull a request
```

- **Color-Coded Legend**: The calendar includes a legend to indicate different levels of contribution intensity:
  - **Low**: Fewer contributions
  - **Medium**: Moderate contributions
  - **High**: High number of contributions
  - **Very High**: Very high number of contributions
- **Responsive Design**: The calendar is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
